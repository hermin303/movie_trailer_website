# Movie Trailer Website

With this project we create a web application, using a server-side code written with Python, that displays a list of our favorite movies.

When the user click on the picture of one of the movies, the trailer of the movie will start playing.

## Structure
To build this project, we will use the following steps:
  - Inside one file named `media.py` Create the class `Movie` that representes the data structure for the movies.
  - Inside in another file named `entertainment_center.py` create the database using objects with the information of each movie according to the features of the class created previously.
  - -create list named `movies` for all the movies.
  - Import methods for the web platform and web browser to display the web application.
  - attach the module `fresch_tomatoes.py` to the function `open_movies_page()` using `movies` as an argument.

## Installation
For this program to run, we:
 - use a web browser (Chrome in my case)
 - install the Python 2.7 version
